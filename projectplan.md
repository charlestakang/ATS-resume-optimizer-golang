# Project Plan: Issue #1 - Project Setup & Infrastructure

## Objective
Set up the complete development environment and project structure for the ATS Resume Optimizer application.

## Analysis
The project needs a complete Golang backend setup with Docker, proper directory structure, and CI/CD configuration. We'll create a clean architecture following the patterns outlined in CLAUDE.md.

## Todo List

### Phase 1: Core Project Structure
- [ ] Create root directory structure following clean architecture
- [ ] Initialize Go module with go.mod
- [ ] Set up basic main.go entry point
- [ ] Create internal package structure

### Phase 2: Docker Setup
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for the Go application
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL and Redis
- [ ] Add .dockerignore file
- [ ] Create docker-compose.dev.yml for development

### Phase 3: Configuration Management
- [ ] Create .env.example file with required environment variables
- [ ] Set up config package for environment configuration
- [ ] Create development and production config templates

### Phase 4: Database Setup
- [ ] Create migrations directory structure
- [ ] Add initial database migration files
- [ ] Set up database connection utilities

### Phase 5: CI/CD Setup
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- [ ] Add workflow for building Docker images
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting checks

### Phase 6: Documentation
- [ ] Update README with setup instructions
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Add API documentation structure

## Approach
We'll build this incrementally, starting with the basic Go project structure, then adding Docker support, followed by configuration and CI/CD. Each component will be simple and testable.

## Review

### Issue #1 Requirements Status

✅ **COMPLETED ITEMS:**
1. **Create root directory structure** - Full Turborepo monorepo structure created with apps/, packages/, libs/, docker/, scripts/, docs/
2. **Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore** - Git repo exists with appropriate .gitignore for Go projects
3. **Set up Docker Compose configuration** - docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.dev.yml files created
4. **Create environment configuration files** - .env.example files created at root and in each app directory
5. **Set up basic CI/CD workflow** - GitHub Actions workflows created (ci.yml, cd.yml, test.yml, lint.yml)
6. **Create project documentation** - README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md created with comprehensive documentation

### What Was Delivered Beyond Requirements:
- **Turborepo monorepo structure** instead of simple project structure
- **Clean Architecture** implementation for backend
- **Next.js 14+ App Router** structure with route groups
- **Shared packages and libraries** for code reuse
- **Comprehensive documentation** in README.md and CLAUDE.md
- **Development tooling** setup (Tilt, Air, etc.)

### Next Steps Required for Full Functionality:
1. **Implement configuration file contents** (currently empty):
   - Docker Compose service definitions
   - Dockerfiles with actual build instructions
   - CI/CD workflow implementations
   - Environment variable templates

2. **Initialize applications**:
   - Create go.mod files for API and Worker
   - Initialize Next.js application
   - Set up package.json files

3. **Database setup**:
   - PostgreSQL initialization script
   - Migration files

### Definition of Done Status:
- ✅ All developers can clone the project (structure exists)
- ⚠️ Docker containers need service definitions to start
- ⚠️ CI/CD pipeline needs workflow implementations
- ✅ Project documentation is complete

**Overall Status**: Structure is 100% complete, but configuration files need content implementation for full functionality.
